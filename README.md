A simple app designed in an afternoon. it doesnt work correctly on mobile all the time but its fun non the less. 

this is my first little svelte project, athough most of the app is wrote in vanila JS the framework did help.

this project is live @ https://cringeorbased.tk

currently the app doesnt store any data, it just pulls data from reddit and then destroys the data when the session ends, however in the future i may look at intergrating some form of anonymised data collection so you can see how others reacted to a certain post 

### Future to do list:

* Anonymous data collection
* allow poeple to build there own "Decks"
* Intergrate firebase login to allow people to save progress
* add graphs and charts

please follow for more stupid / fun games
